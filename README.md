## Background
E-commerce has been producing unicorns across the globe for the past five years. You could just imagine how massive the data these companies are consuming day in and day out. One of the interesting data science use cases in e-commerce is understanding the customer behavior with their purchase pattern. 

And so, this mini-project is focused on segmenting customers based on their purchase pattern using the RFM (Recency-Frequence-Monetary) framework. We developed a script also for reusability for future e-commerce projects that may come about.

## Important Files
